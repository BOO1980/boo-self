        <li>Attention deficit disorder and exectuive functions are tightly linked, but far from synonymoud</li>

            <li>The prefrontal cortext mediates executive functioning and it contain four major circuits
                <ul><li>
                    The What: circuit controls working memory: helping you executre plans, goals and specific steps needed to complete a project
