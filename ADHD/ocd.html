    <h1>OCD and ADHD</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>OCD and ADHD are distinct but also comorbid disorders that can share similar symptoms, behaviours and outcomes</li>
        <li>This overlap can complicate diagosis and treatment for patients with both conditions</li></ul>
    <h2>What is OCD</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>OCD is characterized by having obsessions and/or compulsions</li>
        <li>Obsessions can include recurrent, persistent thoughts, visions and impulses that are experienced as intrusive and inappropriate</li>
        <li>These thoughts cause anxiety and distress to the individual</li>
        <li>Thoughts, impulses and mental images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems</li>
        <li>The individual often attemps to ignore or surpress such thoughts, impulses, or images or to neutralize them with some other thought or action</li></ul>
        <li>The individual recongnises that obsessive thoughts, impulsesm or images are a product of their own mind</li>
        <li>Compulsions can include repetitive behaviours or mental acts that the indivudal feels driven to perform in response to a obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly</li>
        <li>The repetitive behavours or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress, or at preventing some dreaded event or situation</li>
        <li>However, these behaviours or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or they are clearly excessive</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Body-focused repetitive behaviours</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In ADHD the BFRB is mainly to provide stimulation and arousall </li>
            <li>A repetitive behaviour can start with a distraction the individual is rejecting, like a blemish on the face or an uneeven nail</li>
            <li>The sensory nature of these behaviours can be very appealing for the individuas with ADHD, and can also provide some stress relief as well a fidget for foucs</li>
            <li>A behaviour can be goal-oriented and coupled with accomplishments which  can be reinforcing for people with ADHD</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>OCD and executive functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>OCD is also an exective functioning disorder</li>
        <li>When an individual has obsessive thoughts and compulsions, it leads to executive overload, leaving litte toom to attend anything else</li>
        <li>individuals with OCD experience the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Diffculty with planning and with working memory deficts, due to trouble filtering out irrelevant data while feeding a need for completeness</li>
                <li>Selective attention deficit to what is threatening or distressing.  With ADHD, attention is directed to what is simulating</li>
                <li>impared inhibition as an element of compulsivity (inhibition: a feeling that makes ones self-conscious and unable to act in a relaxed and natural way)</li>
                <li>Decicion: making problems due to excessive over-thinking, compared to individuas with ADHD who may be more impulsive</li>
                <li>An inflated sense of responsibility and perfectionism, which can make taking actions and making decisions much more profound then they need to be</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why ADHD is missed in OCD Patients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ADHD and OCD symptoms can intertwine, even though the basis and motivation for the behaviours may differ</li>
        <li>Percieved compulsions might be based in ADHD more than OCD as individuals with ADHD often have to create specific environments and structures to function.</li>
        <li>Sensory sensitivity and defensiveness could be mistaken for perfectionist tendencies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>OCD and ADHD treatment considertions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Patients with OCD and ADHD likely need a combined pharmacotherapy treatment plan comrising both SSRIs and stimulants to treat both disorders</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Behavioural Therapy</h2>
    <ul><li>Exposure plus response prevention (ERP) is the first line treatment for OCD</li>
    <li>It involves exposure to the obsessive thoughts that create anxiety and inhibiting (prevent) the compulsive behaviour</li></ul>
