    <h1>OCD and ADHD</h1>
    <ul><li>OCD and ADHD are distinct but also comorbid disorders that can share similar symptoms, behaviours and outcomes</li>
    <li>This overlap can complicate diagosis and treatment for patients with both conditions</li></ul>
    <h2>What is OCD</h2>
    <ul><li>OCD is characterized by having obsessions and/or compulsions</li>
    <li>
        Obsessions can include recurrent, persistent thoughts, visions and impulses that are experienced as intrusive and inappropriate
    </li>
    <li>
        These thoughts cause anxiety and distress to the individual
    </li>
<li>Thoughts, impulses and mental images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems</li>
<li>The individual often attemps to ignore or surpress such thoughts, impulses, or images or to neutralize them with some other thought or action</li></ul>
<li>The individual recongnises that obsessive thoughts, impulsesm or images are a product of their own mind</li>
<li>Compulsions can include repetitive behaviours or mental acts that the indivudal feels driven to perform in response to a obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly</li>
<li>The repetitive behavours or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress, or at preventing some dreaded event or situation</li>
<li>However, these behaviours or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or they are clearly excessive</li>
<li>Body-focused repetitive behaviours</li>
