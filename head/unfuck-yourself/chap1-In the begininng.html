    <h1>In The Beginning</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>loop of constant internal chatter and judgement that never stops, a little voice telling you that you’re lazy or stupid or not good enough.</li>
        <li>You won’t even notice the degree to which you believe it or are drained by it, you’ll just be spending your day working to overcome the stresses and strains, trying to live your life and at various points facing the resignation that if you can’t get your ass off this damned wheel maybe you are never going to get to where you want in life.</li>
        <li>Always experiencing self defeating monolog </li>
        <li>Most of the conversations you have on any given day are with yourself, all in the solitude and privacy of your own head</li>
        <li>Whether your introverted or extroverted , creative or pratical you spend huge swathes of time talking to you</li>
        <li>Studies show that we have around 50,000 thoughts a day</li>
        <li>Think of all the things you say to yourself that you'd rather not or that you try to overcome or defeat</li>
        <li>While we have little or no say in those automatic and reactionary thoughts, we have a massive say in which of those same thoughts we attach significance to.</li>
        <li>The latest in neuroscience and psychology adds weight to the idea that the kind of talk you engage in has a profound impact on the quality of your life.</li>
        <li>the harmony between thought and reality can be found in the grammar of the language</li>
        <li>studies have continually found that positive self-talk can dramatically improve mood, boost confidence, increase productivity, and more.</li>
        <li>The bad news is that the reverse is also true and negative self talk can not only put us in a bad mood it can also leave us feeling helpless</li>
        <li>The negative self talk can make small problems seem bigger and create problems where none existed before</li>
        <li>Your self talk is fucking you over and in ways you cant even begin to imagine</li>
    </ul>
