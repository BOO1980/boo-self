    <h1>In The Beginning</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>loop of constant internal chatter and judgement that never stops, a little voice telling you that you’re lazy or stupid or not good enough.</li>
        <li>You won’t even notice the degree to which you believe it or are drained by it, you’ll just be spending your day working to overcome the stresses and strains, trying to live your life and at various points facing the resignation that if you can’t get your ass off this damned wheel maybe you are never going to get to where you want in life.</li>
    <li>Always experiencing self defeating monolog </li>
    
    </ul>
