        <li>Am i willing to face my social fears - yes</li>
        <li>Am i willing to ask for a raise of quit my shitty job - yes</li>
        <li>Where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great</li>
        <li>If you are willing to generate the state of willingness thats your doorway to making the effort</li>
        <li>Maybe in fact you are unwilling in many cases that could be the best answer to give</li>
        <li>Sometimes declaring your unwillingness can be just as powerful as declaring willingness</li>
        <li>Are you willing to live with a body thats unhealthy - no</li>

        <li>Are you willing to put up with unworkable unstable relationships - maybe lol </li>
        <li>Only when you are unwilling to continure just simply existing, feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled you will make the effort necessary to make a change</li>
        <li>At times there is no greater motivation to change than the unwillingness to do this any longer</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>The power of purpose</h2>
    <ul><li>Sometimes recognising putting yourself in a place where you are unhappy is often all the impetus required to make an opening for real and lasting change</li>
    <li>If you can cognitively and systematically put yourself here you can cognitively and systematicaly put pull yourself out</li>
<li>He is a wise man who does not griev for the things which he has not but rejoices for those which he has</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reaching for the stars with short arms</h2>
    <ul><li>Some goals simply arnt connected to our reality</li>
    <li>We will all like to be stinking rich but are you willing to work 60,70 80 hours of your week to get it</li>
<li>Have you confronted in reality dealt with what becoming stinky rich might really demand?</li>
<li>Sometimes we have lost the ability to just be ourselves and free to breath life and chose our own path, rather than carry the burden of social or familial expectation</li>
<li>What does all that produce, well a lot of disappointment and unfulfilled human begins thats for sure</li>
<li>Many of us have actually forgotten why we are pursuing what we are pursuing in the first place</li>
<li>All to often we foucs soley on what we dont have, even though deep down we dont really need it, or perhaps even want it</li>
<li>To make sure were striving for what we really want requires a constant check-in with ourseves its not a one and done deal</li>
<li>If you really want those thing then go and get them</li>
<li>Begin today, lay out your stratergy, deal with your realit and take the actions required</li>
<li>If you are not willing to work an extra 10 - 20 hours a week for a new bmw then get  it out of your head as its a complete waste of head space </li>
<li>Deal with your unwillingness to take on the kind of actions accomplishging those things would require and accept you are bullshitting yourself</li>
<li>You will ahve a lot more capacity for loving the life you actually do have and will create some room to begin striving for the things you actually want in life</li>
<li>Face you reality, once you adopt the mindset of i am unwilling you will no longer be filled with guilt, resentment, or regret every time you see something you want</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chart your path</h2>
<ul><li>One of the beautiful things about really taking a hard look at your life and goals is that doing so forces you to re-evaluate the path taht leads to them</li>
<li>Is exercising 30 minutes a day really impossible as your mind has built it up to be?</li>
<li>Most of the time the task were actually facing is a lot simpler then we think it is</li>
<li>The problem is we usually dont take the time to really look at it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plant your flag</h2>
<ul><li>When you start to view the world through the lens of that your'e willing and unwilling to pursure, rather than what it seem you want and dont want, things start to become a lot clearer</li>
<li>Instead of wasting time worrying about the other thing people have you will start focusing on whats really important</li>
<li>You realise that once you replace envy, lust and desire with willingness to change your life for the better, things start to really take shape</li>
<li>Once you frame the obstacles in your life as a matter of willing and unwilling - instead of weighing yourself down with negative opinions of yourself and your cicurcumstance yuou can break through the self imposed barriers that are holding you back</li>
<li>You wont put off the things your truely willing to do</li>
<li>You wont neglect your responsibilities you took on because you feel the strong sense of willingness to do them</li>
</ul>
