    <h1>I expect nothing and accept everything</h1>
    <ul><li>Stop doing all that shit you know you shouldn't be doing and all the shit you know you should be doing</li></ul>
    <h2>Expecting the Expected</h2>
    <ul><li>What we dont see is that were also setting up a world of hidden expectations, the crack and crevices hidden in the foundations of our best plaid plans thay kill of potential idea before it really gets going </li>
    <li>If you have palces in your life where you experience disappointment, resentment, regret, surpression, anger, lethary anywhere you are deflated or have some loss of your personal chutzpah or any other surpressive emotion you have these expectations</li>

    <li>If you look at these places long enough youll see the realtity of that area in your life is some way short of the scenerio yuou had anticipagted in your minds eye</li>
    <li>The greater the gap between you hidden expectations and your reality the worse you will actually feel</li>
    <li>The root cause of upset in marriage is unmet expectations</li>
    <li>The problem is expectation itself.  The upsets strewn throughout your entire life are a product of a thousands of unspoken or unrecongnised expectations that cast a giant shadow across your experients and cause great stress when you are trying to make life fit with your expectatioins and great disappointment when life doesnt match yp to them</li>
        <li>Expectations get in the way of our real lives, our real issues and items that require attention</li>
    <li>Expectations are like a mirage that diverts us from our genuine power and cloud our ability to take pronounced, decisive action</li>
    <li>You end up working on your expectations and having life line up with them rather than taking actions that would positively impact your situation</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Cutting out the middle man of expectations</h2>
<ul><li>You will realise that many difficulties and complications in your life are the direct result of expectations that you have or had.
    <li>faild relationships, dissatisfaction with work, and abandoned diets can be traced right back to expectations</li>
    <li>How many times have you said to yourself "this isnt how i thought it would be"</li>
    <li>The last time you was angry was probably beacayse the gap between how it is and how it should have been  was great</li>
    <li>You harboue an unspoken expectation that people in your life will be agreeable, yoyu expect them to tell the truth and follow throuhh on any agreements you have with them, and when people donnt match those expectations oh boy!</li>
    <li>Tke a pen an paper and write out how that area of life was supposed to turn out how you had planned it</li>
    <li>How should this have gone</li>
    <li>get in touch with the hope and positiveity of that area and where it was supposed to head</li>
    <li>nexr on a seperate piece of paper how this area actually looks, get into detail</li>
    <li>How do you feel now that this part of your life did not meet your expectations</li></li>
    <li>Now look at both pieces paoper side by side your pain, anguish and disappointment is greater in the areas where the gap is widest between what you expected and what you actually have</li>
    <li>uncover the expectations you had inadvertently set up for yourself</li>
    <li>Your problems didnt derail you, your expectatipons do</li>
    <li>The point here is that the expectation of how life should be doesnt do you any good</li>
    <li>Expectations blow things out of proportion and dilute your power to deal with issues effectively and powerfully</li>
    <li>CUT OUT EXPECTATIONS - its much more powerful to come to terms with lifes unpredictability and to engage with your circumstanes for what they are then get bogged down by your refusual to let go of unncecessary or unproductie expectations</li>
    <li>No man steps in the same river twice</li>
    <li>Our minds would love to predict and plan everything thats going to happen, but its simply not possible</li>
    <li>These expectations not only have a negatice effect on our emotional state that actually leave us less powerful than we really could be</li>
    <li>Its so much more effective to simply take things as they present themselves, to live in the moment, and solve issues and items as they arise, than to constantly expect</li>
    <li>Deal with your relatiy</li>

</ul>
<h2>Life is more of a dance than a march</h2>
<ul><li>One mind has all kinds of automatic thought processes that we dont even know are going on</li></ul>
<li>You can take back your freedom to choose, and thats by understanding how your mind works</li>
<h2>When life is appropriate</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I expect nothing and accept everything</li>
    <li>When you expect nothing you are living in the moment</li>
    <li>Your not worrying about your future or rejecting thr past</li>
    <li>Your simply embracing your situation as it comes</li>
    <li>Basically own it</li>
    <li>Dont seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish  them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you</li>
    <li>Next time you catch yourself getting brought down by your expectations, shift things in a different direciton</li>
    <li>Many of us expect our partnets to be a certain way consistently or to anticipate our needs and know exactly what were feeling as if by magic</li>
    <li>Your partner like you is an impefect human with his or own set of complicated emotions and thoguhts</li>
    <li>We oftne expect ohter people to treat us exactly as we treat them</li>
    <li>If we do them a favour for example we expect to get the same favour back in return, it becomes and unspoken debt of sorts</li>
    <li>These expectations grow both in weight and complexity in an intimate or romantic relationship</li>
    <li>You wont belive how much your interactions with other people will improve the moment you let go of expecting, the instant you learn to accept things as they happen</li>
    <li>Your partners, friends and family memebers all have their own desires, perceptions and feelings</li>
    <li>That thing thats got you feeling pissed may not have even registered on their rador</li>
    <li>Instead of silenty expecting something and feelig slighted when it doesnt happen, let go fo that expectation</li>
    <li>If there is something yuou want how about asking for it</li>
    <li>When you end up sticking yourself with resentment, regret, anger, or frustration, remember they are not doing that to you, your doing that part to yourself</li>
    <li>Its about quieting the mind and allowing yourself to act with power in the situations of your life rather then succumbing to your internal and external upsets</li>
    <li>Make plans; but what do you have to gain from being welded to the expectations inherit in it.  Nothing!</li>
    <li>If you succeed you can celebrate, if it fails you can recalibrate</li>
    <li>Dont expect victoy or defeat, plam for victory, learn from deafet</li>
    <li>The expectation of people loving you or respecting you if a pointless exercise too</li>
</ul>
