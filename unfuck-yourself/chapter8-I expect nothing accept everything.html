    <h1>I expect nothing and accept everything</h1>
    <ul><li>Stop doing all that shit you know you shouldn't be doing and all the shit you know you should be doing</li></ul>
    <h2>Expecting the Expected</h2>
    <ul><li>What we dont see is that were also setting up a world of hidden expectations, the crack and crevices hidden in the foundations of our best plaid plans thay kill of potential idea before it really gets going </li>
    <li>If you have palces in your life where you experience disappointment, resentment, regret, surpression, anger, lethary anywhere you are deflated or have some loss of your personal chutzpah or any other surpressive emotion you have these expectations</li>

    <li>If you look at these places long enough youll see the realtity of that area in your life is some way short of the scenerio yuou had anticipagted in your minds eye</li>
    <li>The greater the gap between you hidden expectations and your reality the worse you will actually feel</li>
    <li>The root cause of upset in marriage is unmet expectations</li>
    <li>The problem is expectation itself.  The upsets strewn throughout your entire life are a product of a thousands of unspoken or unrecongnised expectations that cast a giant shadow across your experients and cause great stress when you are trying to make life fit with your expectatioins and great disappointment when life doesnt match yp to them</li>
        <li>Expectations get in the way of our real lives, our real issues and items that require attention</li>
    <li>Expectations are like a mirage that diverts us from our genuine power and cloud our ability to take pronounced, decisive action</li>
    <li>You end up working on your expectations and having life line up with them rather than taking actions that would positively impact your situation</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Cutting out the middle man of expectations</h2>
<ul><li>You will realise that many difficulties and complications in your life are the direct result of expectations that you have or had.
    <li>faild relationships, dissatisfaction with work, and abandoned diets can be traced right back to expectations</li>
    <li>How many times have you said to yourself "this isnt how i thought it would be"</li>
    <li>The last time you was angry was probably beacayse the gap between how it is and how it should have been  was great</li>
    <li>You harboue an unspoken expectation that people in your life will be agreeable, yoyu expect them to tell the truth and follow throuhh on any agreements you have with them, and when people donnt match those expectations oh boy!</li>
    <li>Tke a pen an paper and write out how that area of life was supposed to turn out how you had planned it</li>
    <li>How should this have gone</li>
    <li>get in touch with the hope and positiveity of that area and where it was supposed to head</li>
    <li>nexr on a seperate piece of paper how this area actually looks, get into detail</li>
    <li>How do you feel now that this part of your life did not meet your expectations</li></li>
    <li>Now look at both pieces paoper side by side your pain, anguish and disappointment is greater in the areas where the gap is widest between what you expected and what you actually have</li>
    <li>uncover the expectations you had inadvertently set up for yourself</li>
    <li>Your problems didnt derail you, your expectatipons do</li>
    <li>The point here is that the expectation of how life should be doesnt do you any good</li>
    <li>Expectations blow things out of proportion and dilute your power to deal with issues effectively and powerfully</li>
    <li>CUT OUT EXPECTATIONS - its much more powerful to come to terms with lifes unpredictability and to engage with your circumstanes for what they are then get bogged down by your refusual to let go of unncecessary or unproductie expectations</li>
    <li>No man steps in the same river twice</li>
</ul>
