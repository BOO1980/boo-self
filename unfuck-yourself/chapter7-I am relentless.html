    <h1>I am relentless</h1>
    <ul><li>Our biggest successess are born out of discomfort, uncertainty and risk</li>
    <li>From the nervousness and doubt we feel when we take risks in our careers to the muscle soreness and shortness of breath we experience pumping out another five mintures on the treadmill , our biggest successes are born out of discomfort, uncertainty and risk</li>
<li>Nothing in the world is worth having, or worth doing unless is means effort pain, difficulty</li>
<li>The greater the difficulty the greater the sense of personal accomplishment that comes after</li></ul>
<h2>Being relentless</h2>
<ul><li>Anytime youre working to achieve something youre going against the current</li>
<li>Oftern you are going against the people around you who is trying to push and pull you away from your destination</li>
<li>Anytime you attempt to break out that mold your not messing with your own world, your also messing with thiers.  Because they are used to relating to you as a specific kind of person</li></ul>
<li>Resistance also comes from your own mind to, both your conscious and subconscious thoughts can work against you to stop your dreams right in your tracks</li>
<li>It could be negative</li>
<li>You could overcome these distractions and obejects but sometimes there comes a point on your journey where you sometimes lose track of where you are</li>
<li>relentlessness is the fuel that drives you through</li>
<li>The most sucessful among us got to where they are today because the transcended obstacles</li>
<li>The world doesnt stop you from succeeding; youre not that big of a deal</li>
<li>The only thing that stops you is when you buy into the notion that you are stopped</li>
<li>Sometimes you just have to grind it out, stake your claim and hustle for what you want</li>
<li>You literally have to make it happen</li>
<li>We would accomplish more things if we did not think of them as impossible</li>
<li>The key to becoming relentless is to focus on the problem in front of you</li>
<li>The answer is always out there all you need to do is find it</li>
<li>Then you move forward to your next obstacle</li>
<li>By doing this you never have to wonder where your going</li>
<li>Obstacles are the keys to success and growth</li>
<li>relentlessness is determined action again, and again and again</li>
<li>It is completely fine to get discouranged, even defeated whats ok is not to stop</li>
<li>relentlessness has one direction and that is forward</li>
<li>Even when you dont see anything happening it is!</li>
<li>Even when youre not quite hitting the mark you are</li>
<li>I am relentless</li>
