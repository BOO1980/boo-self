    <h1>I am relentless</h1>
    <ul><li>Our biggest successess are born out of discomfort, uncertainty and risk</li>
    <li>From the nervousness and doubt we feel when we take risks in our careers to the muscle soreness and shortness of breath we experience pumping out another five mintures on the treadmill , our biggest successes are born out of discomfort, uncertainty and risk</li>
<li>Nothing in the world is worth having, or worth doing unless is means effort pain, difficulty</li>
<li>The greater the difficulty the greater the sense of personal accomplishment that comes after</li></ul>
<h2>Being relentless</h2>
<ul><li>Anytime youre working to achieve something youre going against the current</li>
<li>Oftern you are going against the people around you who is trying to push and pull you away from your destination</li>
<li>Anytime you attempt to break out that mold your not messing with your own world, your also messing with thiers.  Because they are used to relating to you as a specific kind of person</li></ul>
