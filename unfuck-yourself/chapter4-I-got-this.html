    <h1>I got this</h1>
    <ul><li>Negative experiences we have rarely stay contained to that one isuue</li>
    <li>They spread like a toxic chemical, those experiences seep into all aspects of our lives</li>
    <li>For example: if you have financial trouble, you either consciously or sub consciously stress about it at dinner</li>
    <li>Which means you dont enjoy your meal</li>
    <li>You start feeling on edge around family, you feel resentful toward your spouse and distant from your children</li>
    <li>Your annoyed the dog barks or when your neighbours make too much noise.  Little things like traffice and long queues begin prompting your frustrations</li>
    <li>Its like your whole life is tainted, as your smaller problems leak into the bigger picture</li>
    <li>Like a coffee spill on your desk, small problems quickly spread and create bigger ones</li>
    <li>As the spilled liquid relentlessy heads for your laptop, phone and stack of bills you hopelessly paid at random</li>
    <li>The little mess can influence all areas of your life until your emotions surrounding that one area become the lens through which you see everything you end up thinking <ul><li>Life is too hard</li>
    <li>Ill never make it through this</li>
<li>Everyones a jerk</li>
<li>Im done with this shit</li></ul>
</li><li>None of the these sentiments reflect reality not matter what you currently think, but rather your perception of your reality</li>
<li>Unfortunately knowing this makes no different whatsoever when you are stuck right in the middle of it</li>
<li>We need to shift how we view our problems and the world and adopt a new powerfullu opitmistic and grounded approach</li>
<li>If all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portions, most people would be content to take their own and depart</li>
<li>If we are brutally honest with ourselves well realise that our own problems are pretty insignificant in comparison

</li>
<li>Get connected to your reality your real life instead of your emotionally soaked self-talk narrative about your life</li>
<li>Getting connected to your reality-based perspective will serve to help you face life and all of its problems with a powerful attitude</li>
<li>It is challenging to stay levelheaded, our problems are still real, they still hurt and they can still result in our emotions getting the better of us</li>
<li>When you do start to have those crappy feelings take a step back, waaay back and keep going until you picture your life for what it really is</li>
<li>Firstly i advise my clients to start by looking at their entire life. like a railroad track.  Running to the lft and right as far as the eye can see</li>
<li>Now look waaay down those tracks to the left this is your past this is what youve already covered</li>
<li>Take the time to think about the most memorable experiences from your life</li>
<li>Birth of your first child, hetting your house, meeting james</li>
<li>Remeber the little things like childhood memories, memorable tastes, sights and sounds that embrace you in their familairity and inspire feeling of warmth and joy</li>
<li>Recall all the times where you struggled, suffered set backs or got knocked down</li>
<li>If you experienced a tough childhood let all of that in here</li>
<li>Remember all the problems you faced - and eventually overcame</li>
<li>A lot of them may be very similar to what you're dealing with today</li>
<li>You probably felt a lot of the same emotions back then too.  You though youd never get over your ex, that you never find a better job or that you wouldnt live through the humilations of some situations, but you did </li>
<li>Looking back some of these problems might seem a little silly now</li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking to the future</h2>
<ul><li>To the right is your future, heres where youll find the things to come, all of the experiences and events awaiting for you in life</li>
<li>New relationships with people youve yet to meet</li>
<li>Placed to visit youve never been</li>
<li>There are reams of untapped potential and opportunties waiting in your future</li>
<li>People will leave your life as quickly and eadily as the come to it, your lose money, things will break, your dog will die</li>
<li>But you get through it all, the good and the bad like you did in the pasta</li>
</ul>
<h2>A sea of somethings</h2>
<ul><li>It is in our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light</li>
<li>As you examine all the things youve experienced and all the things youve yet to experience take a moment to examine what you are currently dealing with today</li>
<li>So your journey wasnt as smooth as you wanted it to be, does that mean you just going to let yourself get blown off course?</li>
<li>You definitely shouldnt let what happends in one area of your life affect the outlook on the whole life</li>
<li>You cant afford to allow your struggles at work to make you miserable at home or let your relationship troubles affect your mood in the office</li>
<li>Face your problems as they come one by one give them the attention they need and move on, bundling them all togther into a morass of confusion and letting them overwhelm you</li>
<li>It take precision, patience and displine of thought</li>
<li>Work trhough each item pragmatically and with a solution in mind</li>
<li>Remember everything is solvable and if you cant see a solution it means you havnt worked it out yet</li>
<li>Often the reason you cant see the solutuon is because you are too close to the problem.</li>
<li>Zoom out, and zoom out a lot and look at the big picture</li>
<li>This is a similar phenomenon to what pyschologists call "cognitive restructuring"</li>
<li>Shifting the way in which your problems are presenting themselves in your life</li>
<li>Our minds naturally play tricks on us, twisiting and distoriting our thoughts in ways that are not always rational</li>
<li>Were at the mercy of cognitive biases, emotions and misconceptions and mostly of its completely unseen by us</li>
<li>Thats one of the peculiar things about moods - we often fool ourselves and create misery by telling ourselves things that simply are not true</li>
<li>Sometimes were too close, too involved in it to even realize</li>
<li>If things are still out of focus, take another step back and another and another</li>
<li>Ask yourself what is really going on here, until you experience your problems cleanly, clearly and free of an emotional anchor</li>
<li>Persist until you can see the whole course of your life and realize that you current problems are just another bump in the road</li>
<li>When you've finally put things into perspective you come to your assertion I got this</li>
<li>I got this doesnt mean to say you have the perfect solution it means that you have your hand on the wheel</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
