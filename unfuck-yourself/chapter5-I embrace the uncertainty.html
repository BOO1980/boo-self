    <h1>I Embrace the Uncertainty</h1>
    <ul><li>Uncertainty is where new happens</li></ul>
<h2>You're and addict</h2>
<ul><li>You are craving for prediction</li>
<li>You are constantly looking ahead, trying to figure out whats going to happen before it actually does</li>
<li>We seek the certain and avoid the uncertain</li>
<li>We want to know what to expect, where to go, what to wear</li>
<li>We want to be prepared, we want to be safe</li>
<li>Its like an addiction</li>
<li>We are sizing people up before we even know them, predicting their character in seconds</li>
<li>Many of us stay inside our own little organised cerain world</li>
<li>Every step into the unknown is like a dance with death</li></ul>
<li>The same survival instincts that once kept us alive can noe be the very thing that keeps us from living</li>
<h2>A paradigm of potential</h2>
<ul><li>Our obsession with certainty can be tragic and counterproductive for two reasons</li>
<li>first uncertainty is where things happen</li>
<li>Uncertainty is your personal pathway to opportunity, its the enviroment in which you grow, experience new things and produce new unprecedented results</li>
<li>Uncertainity is where new happens</li>
<li>The desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise</li>
<li>When you stick to what you're comfortable with doing the same things you've always done, youre in effect living in the past and not moving forward</li>
<li>Your repeating things and behaviour that one time in your life were risky, since you didnt know what they would lead to, but have since turned into routine</li>
<li>How can you go to new places if you never leave the house</li>
<li>How can you make friends and start romances without meeting new people</li>
<li>How can you do anything new by doing what you've always done</li>
<li>You cant</li>
<li>The truth is you cant even predict what the people you know will do, let alone people you dont know</li>
<li>You cant even predict your own thoughts and feeling</li>
<li>Think of the many time you've rushed to judge and then later changed your mind</li>
<li>How will you ever get a raise if you dont take the risk of asking?</li>
<li>How will you get ahead in your career if you're always holding on to certainty and comfort</li>
<li>In any momemnt of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worts thing you can do is nothing</li>
<li>Missing the target isnt the worst thing you can do.  Not taking the shot is</li>
<li>People succeed because they were certain they were going to succeed, they succeeded because they didnt let uncertainty stop them, they did it anyway</li>
<li>They ignore their doubts and kept pushing forward</li>
<li>They were relentless when the only thing they had to fuel them was relentlessness</li>
<li>As soon as they chose certainty over uncertainty they stopped achieving</li>
<li>When were no longer uncertain about moeny they desire, the need even to pursue it recedes</li>
<li>Eventually we settle for certainty</li>
<li>Uncertainty has large power in our lives, it can make us or break us</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chasing what doesnt exist</h2>
<ul><li>No matter how much you chase certainy you never really be able to hold it or retain it, because it doesnt exist</li>
<li>The universer will always send us little reminders of chaos and power, and no one is expempt</li>
<li>No matter how hard we try, we can never predict exactly what life will bring, our plans will falter at some point eventually</li>
<li>The person who accepts how unpredictable and uncertain life is had no choice but to embrace it</li>
<li>Therye not afraid of the uncertain its just a part of life</li>
<li>They dont seek out certainty because they know it doesnt really exist</li>
<li>Many of the things we think of as hard facts arnt.  Theyre half-truths.  There assumptions, they miinterpreations, theyre guesses, they base on congnitive biases, faulty information or conditioning</li>
<li>When you try to stay in your comfort zone, you never truly feel comfortable</li>
<li>Theres always a nagging feeling you could be doing more, theres always that desire for a life thats better than the one you ahve now</li>
<li>The more we try to stay comfortable today, the more uncomfortable well be tomorrow.  There really is no destinations, there is only exploring and exploring</li></ul>
<li>If you want to win, you have to be willing to be judged by others</li>
<li>Step forward and be judged</li>
<li>Part of our aversion to uncertainty comes from our fear of being judged by others</li>
<li>We are in a very realy way afraid of what the tribe things and the prospect of being thrown out</li>
<li>If we put ourselves in uncomfortable sitations maybe we''l look awkward and people think were weird</li>
<li>If we push our limits and try to achieve new things maybe well fail and people will thingk were a failure</li>
<li>If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid</li>
<li>Your never going to achieve your true potential if your're hooked by what other people think</li>
<li>In fact you could change your life overnight if you simply abandon the notion that other peoples opinions doesnt matter</li>
<li>Life goes on opinion heavy or opinion light</li>
<li>If you want to win you have to be willing to be judged by other and not let it get to you</li>
<li>If you want to do something truly great youll have to accpt that some people are going to think your delusional or an idiot or righteous</li>
<li>The person who avoids the uncertain doesn do this, they are too afraid of being judgedm there too afraid to look foolish or stupid they are stopped one foot nailed to the floor by an illusion</li>
<h2>Embracing the uncertain</h2>
<ul><li>That's because youre rejecting and avoiding uncertainty, your afraid of it</li>
<li>Youre trying to control and know things that you simply cant know or control</li>
<li>Personal assertion.  I embrace the uncertainty</li>
<li>Whille the unknown can hold plenty of bad things, it also holds everything good as well</li>
<li>Life is overflowing with opportunity and progress</li>

</ul>
<h2>Opportunity Hunting</h2>
<ul><li>Embracing uncertainty has the power to transform your life, from you personal relationships to your career</li>
<li>Youll no longer be hiding from life, you be living it</li>
<li>When you stop searching for certainty you will stop trying to make sense of everything and a lot of stress will simply melt away</li>
<li>There is literally nothing to figure out</li>
<li>What causes most of your worry is trying to predict the future and the refusing to accept thing when they dont or arnt going your way</li>
<li>Foucs on the things you can control and release yourself from worrying about what you can't</li></ul>
