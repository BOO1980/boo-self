    <h1>I am not my thoughts; I am what i do</h1>
    <ul><li>You are not defined by what's inside your head.  You are what you do wtih your actions</li>
        <li>Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind, but great actions speak to all mankind</li>
        <li>Most of us let out internal condition weigh heavily on what we do</li>
        <li>The greatest performers still have the internal doubts etc but they act anyway</li>
        <li>Its difficult to have a say in, or let alone control what you think about</li>
        <li>We are not even aware of the majority of the things we think about</li>
        <li>We have just as many pointless, irrelevent thoughts as we do important ones</li>
        <li>Then there is those default thoughts that pop in your head day in and dya out</li>
        <li>Thoughts of unworthiness, being judged, not belonging or some lack of competence</li>
        <li>No matter how hard you try, youre going to have the occasional negative thought</li>
        <li>You dont have to feel like today is your day, you just have to act like it is</li>
        <li>We become just by performing just actions</li>
        <li>We become temperate by performing temperate actions</li>
        <li>We become brave by performing brave actions</li>
        <li>Thoughts without actions are just that, thoughs</li>
        <li>Your negative thoughts about yourself, orther or your circumstaces will have no impact on your success as long as you leave the where they lie</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How doing changes your thinking</h2>
    <ul><li>Doing get you doing what you need to do</li>
    <li>But its the quickest way to change your thoughts</li>
<li>We know your thoughts can become your relaity</li>
<li>When you reality is one of acting on things that are in your best interests, your thoughts will actually shift to match that</li>
<li>If you always attack the task at hand without hesitation, your thoughts start to become intuitive </li>
<li>When you are fully immersed in something all of your problems or negative conversations seem to disappear</li>
<li>When you are cognitively and genuinely engaged in a practive or prohect, that internal chatter gets quieter and quieter</li></ul>
<li>When you focus your attention on the action at hand, eventually your consciousness starts to get the idea</li>
<li>Our minds often have an unrealisting perception of the world, peppered with interpretation, misunderstanding, automatic behaviours and opinions, and culturaal and famillial programming all laid on top of our lives</li>
<li>The more we strive to get our reality to match this design the more we struggle</li>
<li>The gap between how life is and how we thing life is, is often the black hole in which we fruitlessly labor.</li>
<li>By exposing outselves to the situations we resist, we train our brains to see the world more cognitively</li>
<li>The next time your feeling or experiencing any sort of negative, or diminishing thout that disempowers you move on immediately</li>
<li>Act in a way thats in your best interests rather then in a way that is dominated by how you automatically think and feel</li>
<li>Inaction breeds doubt and fear</li>
<li>Action breeds confidence and courage</li>
<li>If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it.  Go out and get busy</li>
<li>When we choose action instead of inaction, when we act beyond our automatic thoughts something interesting happens, we start to forget about the things that are bothering us</li>
<li>When we act we do not have time for anything else, its hard to focus on your internal worrying when your busy getting things done</li>
<li>Put your thoughts aside and move</li>
<li>Chnage your life by changing your actions, thats the only way</li>
<li>Its all about action: Going out there, doing it and taking all your negative bullshit along for the ride</li>
<li>Its never going to any better, any easier or any more understandble.</li>
<li>Action may not bring happiness but there is no happiness without action</li>
<h2>Seperating your thoughts from who are you</h2>
<ul><li>I am not my thoughts i am what i do</li>
<li>When we experience, when we face our fears when we accompish, even when we fail, we truly change who we are</li>
<li>You coud be the smartest person in the world, but that doesnt mean a thing if you dont take action</li></ul>
