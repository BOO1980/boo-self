    <h1>In The Beginning</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>loop of constant internal chatter and judgement that never stops, a little voice telling you that you’re lazy or stupid or not good enough.</li>
        <li>You won’t even notice the degree to which you believe it or are drained by it, you’ll just be spending your day working to overcome the stresses and strains, trying to live your life and at various points facing the resignation that if you can’t get your ass off this damned wheel maybe you are never going to get to where you want in life.</li>
        <li>Always experiencing self defeating monolog </li>
        <li>Most of the conversations you have on any given day are with yourself, all in the solitude and privacy of your own head</li>
        <li>Whether your introverted or extroverted , creative or pratical you spend huge swathes of time talking to you</li>
        <li>Studies show that we have around 50,000 thoughts a day</li>
        <li>Think of all the things you say to yourself that you'd rather not or that you try to overcome or defeat</li>
        <li>While we have little or no say in those automatic and reactionary thoughts, we have a massive say in which of those same thoughts we attach significance to.</li>
        <li>The latest in neuroscience and psychology adds weight to the idea that the kind of talk you engage in has a profound impact on the quality of your life.</li>
        <li>the harmony between thought and reality can be found in the grammar of the language</li>
        <li>studies have continually found that positive self-talk can dramatically improve mood, boost confidence, increase productivity, and more.</li>
        <li>The bad news is that the reverse is also true and negative self talk can not only put us in a bad mood it can also leave us feeling helpless</li>
        <li>The negative self talk can make small problems seem bigger and create problems where none existed before</li>
        <li>Your self talk is fucking you over and in ways you cant even begin to imagine</li>
        <li>If human emotions largely result from thinking, then one may appreciably control one's thoughts - or by changing the internalized sentences of self-talk, with which one largely created the feeling in the first place.</li>
        <li>Some of the things we say and do aren’t always particularly rational but we seem to say and do them anyway!</li>
        <li>In addition we never really see what we are leaving ourselves with or the emotional residue of engaging in even the mildest of negative self-talk.</li>
        <li>It’s not always dramatic self-talk, sometimes it’s subtle but equally disempowering. </li>
        <li>Sometimes negative self-talk leads to anger, sadness, or frustration that manifests in different or seemingly unrelated situations.</li>
        <li>This kind of self talk doesnt make your life any easier.</li>
        <li>The more you tell yourself how hard something is, the harder it will actually seems</li>
        <li>We dont realize how negative thoughts impact our mood and behaviour, as a result we end up doing - or not doing things our rational minds wants us to do.</li>
        <li>With enough of these little persistent items hanging around it’s easy to collapse them in with the bigger, more important things until we find ourselves overwhelmed or exhausted by life. </li>
        <li></li>
    </ul> 
    <h2>How language changes our lives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The way we talk doesn’t only affect us in the moment.</li>
        <li>It can seep into our subconscious and become internalized, changing our thoughts and behavior in the long term.</li>
        <li>In real everyday terms, the way we talk to ourselves and others instantly shapes how we perceive life, and that same perception directly impacts our behavior right there in the moment.</li>
        <li>If you’re sometimes talking about how “unfair” life is, you’ll start to act according to that view, perceiving slights where none exist or, as studies have shown, putting less effort into your work because you’ve already determined it won’t accomplish anything.</li>
        <li>The unfair view will quickly become your reality.</li>
        <li>the person who views success as if it were just around the corner will not only work his butt off to achieve it but be energized and alive to it and all the while acting on that fundamental view of success.</li>
        <li>believing you will be successful is only one, albeit important, part of success.</li>
        <li>there is a way to accomplish great things without that belief, although the ride will be a bit rougher!</li>
        <li>It’s entirely within our power to determine how we think about and talk about our problems.</li>
        <li>They can be a nuisance or a stepping stone.</li>
        <li>They can hold us down or lift us up. </li>
        <li>It’s entirely within our power to determine how we think about and talk about our problems. They can be a nuisance or a stepping stone. They can hold us down or lift us up.</li>
        <li>outside events hold no power over us at all. We create our own reality with our minds.</li>
        <li>“Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears"</li>
        <li>That what you think you can and cannot do is influenced much more directly by some subconscious response than the reality of life itself? </li>
        <li>If you keep looking out there, outside of yourself, to your circumstances and feverishly working to get out of them you’ll keep getting the same response. No power, no joy, no vitality.</li>
        <li>No power, no joy, no vitality. At best it’s a seesaw of success and disappointment, happiness and despair.</li>
        <li>Sometimes your circumstances just don’t change, sometimes they stagnate and crystallize.</li>
        <li>What if that thing you’re working toward, that thing you are sure will make you happier or more confident, doesn’t happen? What Then?</li>
        <li>Even if it does arrive someday, what happens to your life between now and that day? </li>
        <li>Scientists have discovered that our thoughts can actually change the physical structure of our brains. </li>
        <li>As we go through life learning and experiencing new things, our brains are constantly arranging and rearranging the neural pathways that control how we think and behave. </li>
        <li>We can use strong assertive langugae over time to create lasting change in our lives</li>
        <li>We can determine our emotions by steering our thoughs</li>
        <li>We can shape those thoughts by being conscious of and diligent about our words and the kind of language we engage in. </li>
        <li>It all starts by making a conscious choice to talk in a way that’s helpful rather than harmful.</li>
        <li>By using the right kind of language and framing our problems in a more readily accessible light, we can quite literally change the way we see and interact with the world.</li>
    </ul>
