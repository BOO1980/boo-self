    <title>Chapter 3 - I am wired to win</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>I am wired to win</h1>
    <ul><li>You've knocked out goal after goal, cruising to an undefeated record.  Everything you set your mind to comes true</li>
    <li>You are winning at the life you have</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Building the mystery</h2>
    <ul><li>What if you are actually driven to prove that the notion that no one will ever love you</li>
    <li>What if it was planted there as a subconscious reaction to a turbulent childhood, bad breakups or the like</li>
<li>What if with this pattern buried deep in your subconcious you actively and deliberately undermind the success of your own relationship</li>
<li>You became sensitive to problems where there were apparently none</li>
<li>You started picking and getting anoouted by and blowing up at the tinest of things</li>
<li>Over time you proved your point and the relationship reached its obvious final and natural conclusion</li>
<li>You were convinced you wernt worthy of a loving relationship, so you systematically set out to prove it and you succeeded.  Congrats :)</li>
<li>Our thoughts are so powerful that they are constantly pushing you towards your goals</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruler of your domain</h2>
<ul><li>Research found that 95% of what do in our day-to-day life is controlled by our sub-conscious</li></ul>
<li>This means out of all the thing you say and do, only a tiny fraction of them are said or done with a  true sendse of volitions</li>
<li>You're basically on autopoliot - mindlessly gouging your way through lifes predicatble muddy field</li>
<li>Cant seem to increase your income? cant see to lose weight? have you considered the subconsious, concealed belifs about your income and your weight that may be driving your action or lack of it</li>
<li>You automatically relate yourself as belonging to a certain ecomic class, with certain levels of fitness and your actions serve to keep you in place right where you most familiar to yourself</li>
<li>You need to uncover and realise the ways in which you have limited yourself</li>
<li>In short, the conclusions that you have come to about yourself, others and life itself</li>
<li>These conclusion are the limit of your potential, its only when you have broken through those conclusion and can experience a life outside your current existence that you start to understand the power of this phenomenom</li>
<li>What it take to move out of that domain you firmly placed yourself in is going to require some significant changes to your automatic thoughts</li>
<li>We are always winning at proving something, you win at proving either you have no time or that yot you are a procrationator or a loser by getting things done at the very last minute</li>
<li>The key here is to question yourself, look at your actions</li>
<li>We hold certain beliefs about ourselves or life in general that we prove right time and time again through everyday actions</li>
<li>Im not worthy of love, im not smart, im a failure, im not as capable as i used to be.  With these kinds of repeats stuck in your subconcious is it any wonder that you are masterful in consistently proving them right?</li>
<li>To succeed in another more positive way youd have to prove those firmly held beliefs wrong</li>
<li>For your persona that's a ground shaking idea that is almost too much to bear - in would in fact unsettle the very foundations of who you have become</li>
<li>Many of my clients i have found have one particular thing in common: the subconscious desire to prove that their parents did a bad job raising them</li>
<li>You might try to prove that your parents failed to raise you well by treating your body like crap, getting arrested, becoming addicted to alcohol or drugs, constantly failing in relationships, chronic financial crises</li>
<li>All of these are real - life exampes that some of my clients discovered about themselves, that one or both parents failed at their job</li>
<li>That theur experiences as a child did not adequately prepare them for adulthood</li>
<li>This gives the person a ready made explanation as to why they did what they did and why</li>
<li>We are survival machines and what better way to survive, whats to come than by reliving whats been, after all its got you this far regardingless of how bad or negative it has been you have survived</li>
</body>
<h2>Creating a gameplan</h2>
<ul><li>The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts, therefore guard accordingly and take that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature</li>
<li>I am wired to win</li>
<li>We have to start filling bucket with the right ideas</li>
<li>Think about the things you'd like to change in your life,</li>
<li>Where would you really like to see progress what do you really want to accomplish</li>
<li>Take that goald and break it down what steps do you need to take to achieve it</li>
<li>What are the milestones you need to set out to identify your progress</li>
<li>If you want to lose weight, think about how youll need to change your diet, get more exercise</li>
<li>Subconsciour thoughts are deeply ingrained in your psyche so it can take a lot of thinking, imagincationa and commitments to transform these invisible yet powerful thoughts into ones that better align with your stated goals</li>
<li>The more you think about your future and what you want to accomplish the deeper those throught processes will work their way into your mind and take hold</li>
<li>The better you understand your patterns the better shot you have in altering them</li>
<li>We are wired to win, define you game and embrace the challange and strive to understand yourself in deeper more meaningful ways</li>
<li>The more aware you beome of your hardwiring, the more space and opportunity become available in those areas</li>
<li>Step out there, trust yourself</li>
</ul>
