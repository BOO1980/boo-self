    <title>Chapter 3 - I am wired to win</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>I am wired to win</h1>
    <ul><li>You've knocked out goal after goal, cruising to an undefeated record.  Everything you set your mind to comes true</li>
    <li>You are winning at the life you have</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Building the mystery</h2>
    <ul><li>What if you are actually driven to prove that the notion that no one will ever love you</li>
    <li>What if it was planted there as a subconscious reaction to a turbulent childhood, bad breakups or the like</li>
<li>What if with this pattern buried deep in your subconcious you actively and deliberately undermind the success of your own relationship</li>
<li>You became sensitive to problems where there were apparently none</li>
<li>You started picking and getting anoouted by and blowing up at the tinest of things</li>
<li>Over time you proved your point and the relationship reached its obvious final and natural conclusion</li>
<li>You were convinced you wernt worthy of a loving relationship, so you systematically set out to prove it and you succeeded.  Congrats :)</li>
<li>Our thoughts are so powerful that they are constantly pushing you towards your goals</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ruler of your domain</h2>
<ul><li>Research found that 95% of what do in our day-to-day life is controlled by our sub-conscious</li></ul>
<li>This means out of all the thing you say and do, only a tiny fraction of them are said or done with a  true sendse of volitions</li>
<li>You're basically on autopoliot - mindlessly gouging your way through lifes predicatble muddy field</li>
<li>Cant seem to increase your income? cant see to lose weight? have you considered the subconsious, concealed belifs about your income and your weight that may be driving your action or lack of it</li>
<li>You automatically relate yourself as belonging to a certain ecomic class, with certain levels of fitness and your actions serve to keep you in place right where you most familiar to yourself</li>
<li>You need to uncover and realise the ways in which you have limited yourself</li>
<li>In short, the conclusions that you have come to about yourself, others and life itself</li>
<li>These conclusion are the limit of your potential, its only when you have broken through those conclusion and can experience a life outside your current existence that you start to understand the power of this phenomenom</li>
<li>What it take to move out of that domain you firmly placed yourself in is going to require some significant changes to your automatic thoughts</li>
